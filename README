# 🤖 AI Resume Sidekick (Chrome Extension)

A powerful Chrome Extension designed to work alongside the **AI Resume Builder**. It bridges the gap between LinkedIn job postings and your resume tailoring engine, serving as a "Co-Pilot" for your job applications.

**Note:** This extension is a helper tool. It does NOT automate applications in the background (which risks account bans). It operates only when you click it, acting like a human assistant to speed up your workflow.

## ✨ Features

-   **🔍 Smart Job Scanner:** Instantly extracts Job Descriptions from LinkedIn job pages.
    -   *Automatic Mode:* Detects the main content block.
    -   *Manual Mode:* Supports highlighting text manually if automatic detection fails.
-   **📋 Instant Clipboard Sync:** Copies the JD and immediately opens your local AI Resume Builder (`localhost:3000`) for tailoring.
-   **✍️ Auto-Fill "Easy Apply":** acting like a password manager, it auto-fills LinkedIn "Easy Apply" forms with your saved details (Name, Email, Phone, City, LinkedIn URL).
-   **🔒 Privacy First:** All your data is stored locally in your browser (`chrome.storage.local`). Nothing is sent to any external server.

## 🛠️ Installation

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
| :--- | :--- |
| **"No content found"** | The scraper couldn't find the JD. Highlight the text manually with your mouse and try clicking the button again. |
| **"Auto-copy blocked"** | Browsers sometimes block clipboard access. The extension will show a text box with the content; simply copy it manually (Ctrl+C). |
| **Settings not saving** | Ensure you clicked "Save Profile" and saw the green success message. Restart Chrome if issues persist. |
